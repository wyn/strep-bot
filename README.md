Example Symphony Chatroom Bot in Python

### Suspicious Transaction Reporting (STREP) bot
This code demonstrates a simple Symphony chat bot that, given a date and a ticker, will
* Check Twitter to see if there are any tweets relating to that ticker in the run up to the given date
* Present these as a date sorted table with selectable rows
* Allow the user to then select which tweets are relevent to the transaction thus demonstrating evidence refuting the suspicious nature of the trade

It is a prototype for automating a process that a compliance officer would do in a bank/financial institution.

A more realistic production-ready tool would use multiple news sources, not just Twitter.

This example was coded up for the Symphony Innovate 2019 Hackathon in London.
